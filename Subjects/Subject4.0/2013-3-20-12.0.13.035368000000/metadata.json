[["Notes","The device didn't work, so I had to recalibrate the sensors.  While he tried to use it several times, he didn't really get to experience the device working at all.  He did have to wait a while. Perhaps that helped the concept \"sink in\" as his results in the seccond recording are really quite good."]]
