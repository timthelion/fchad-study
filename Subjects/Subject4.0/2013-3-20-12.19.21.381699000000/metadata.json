[["Notes","Near the end of this session we see two confounding factors.  One is, that since things were going well, I may have responded more quickly in my confirmations than at other times.  My responce time cannot be considered completely constant. When one is bored out of their mind, no matter how hard one tries, they cannot respond at the same rate as if they were excited by peadagogic success.  The seccond factor, is that Subject 4 began to feel confident enough that he would continue on his own.  At no point were the subjects instructed that they must wait for my confirmation to continue. Indeed, the hope was, that subjects WOULD learn to independently use the device.  Despite the fact that Subject 4's growing independence was a success for the device, it is a confounding factor when we look at statistics, as we see his increasing speed is in part due to the fact that he was no longer waiting for me to tell him if he had guessed the letters correctly.  His confidence was not unfounded, he did not make many mistakes."]]
