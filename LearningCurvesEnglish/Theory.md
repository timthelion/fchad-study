Implicit vs Explicit learning

Functional imaging

implicit learning seperated from explicit learning

125 students from University of Virginia are asked to fill a SRT task.

Task, match one of 4 keystrokes to a coresponding dot on the screen.

Explicit instructions:

Learn the 12 element sequence.  (Explicit aid in learling the task.)

Implicit: respond as quickly as possible.  Sequence is still there, not explicitly pointed out.

The subjects given the explicit sequence learning task at first performed much more slowly than the subjects performing the implicit task, however, their responce times decreased as the study continued and the resulting responce times were similar to those subjects given the implicit task.  It seems to me, that in the first hour of using the novel Braille display all learning is implicit.  The subjects of my study are given an explicit verbal explanation of the devices function, and explicit verbal instructions as to what to do during the study.

In the University of Virginia study, subjects are given a task which is simple enough, that they may begin implicit training almost right away.  However, the novel braille display is significantly more complex and explicit learning MUST come first.  Furthermore, since my subjects are blind, implicit learning involving "watch and copy" learning models is impossible.  All initial learning is either unguided exploration and discovery or explicit verbal command.

Feijen, Lieke. Hodjes, Nicola J. Beek, Peter J. "Acquiring a Novel Coordination Skill without Practicing the Correct Motor Commands. Journal of Motor Behavior, Vol. 42, No. 5, 2010

While blind individuals cannot engage in "watch and copy" learning they can experience a movement without peforming that movement actively.  That is, we can place their hands where their hands can go on the device.  

Optocon modes:

"A second conclusion is that the performance for very brief, static patterns could be improved considerably by increasing the amplitude of vibration generation the pattern. It is conceivable that if the amplitude of the Optacon display could be increased to even greater levels, the percentage correct for letters presented for 4 msec would be as great as that for letters presented for 200msec." <- Is this meaningfull?  I think not, because back masking will probably still have more affect on a 4ms impulse than a 200ms stimulation  Page 10.

4msec is not a vibration but a single impulse.

It would be good to look into adding a backward mask dellay pg 12. in the future.

Page 15, no reason to exceed 50msec for static paterns.

  Why do I use such a large cell?  "As a result, in the single cell case, the finger will not feel the transition from one character to the next, but only the configurational changes in the cell’s pins according to the following character.  Since the finger is not moving on the braille characters, speed performance will of course be slower than on 20-, 40- or 8O-cell braille displays (46.1 wpm for fast readers and 12.0 wpm for slow readers)."

  Interestingly, when I showed a much earlier version of the device to a blind person they commented that it would be easier to controll with buttons than with the sensor interface.



Wearable4Blind.pdf Velázquez, Ramiro. Wearable Assistive Devices for the Blind

Categorizes electronic travel aids(ETAs).  Categorizes the devices into devices that project information into tactile input or auditory input.  ETAs are categorized by "instruction based" and "image based".  Instruction based devices tell the blind person what to do. Image based devices try to show the blind person what a sighted person would normally see.  Lists many types of ETAs.  There are ETAs that project to the toung, fingures, back, forarm, waist and foot.  Remarks that with such a variety, one would think that ETAs would be more popular.  Cites learning curves and user acceptance as the main reason ETAs are not popular.  I dissagree.  I think that ETAs are not accepted because their performance is not acceptable.  Computer image processing is not at such a point where I would want to trust a computer to tell me if I could walk forward without fear of falling off a cliff or getting hit by a car.

examining the proactive and retroactive.pdf Patterson, Jae T. Lee, Timothy D. Examining the Practive and Retroactive Placement of Augmented Information for learning a novel computer alphabet.

The subjects were to learn a novel computer alphabet.  Palms so called graphiti alphabet, which was designed to allow easier recognition of handwritten text on the PDA computer.  This study is interesting because the PDA handwritten alphabet is similar to the normal alphabet, just as the large FCHAD characters are familiar yet different.  

HCI.Beyond.The.GUI.May.2008.pdf - touch / page 30(49 pdf)  - listing of different sensors.  We want to trigger the Meissner's corpuscle as well as Merkels disks(as these are very acturate in their spacial information) but to do this we need significant actuation(as they are deap in the skin).  The use of slight vibration can help us, by allowing us to emply the Pacinian corpuscles(which respond best at 200Hz).
 The authors of the HCI publication also destinguish four subjective sensation types: "preasure, touch, vibration, and tickle." I would think that tickle is produced by way of movement across the skin.  It has been noted that single cell braille devices are less affective because the character does not move across the skin, and I would certainly rate my own experience with print braille to be, completely subjectively, to a great extent tickling.  I have also found, subjectively, that placing a cloth over the device while reading, so that the dot pins are covered improves my ability to read.  I think there are two factors, one of which is that being hit directly by the metal pins can become painful after a period of reading. The seccond factor is that the cloth tickles my skin as it moves across my fingure, thus providing extra sensory information. 
  While we might look at studies of Just Noticeable Differences(JNDs)(page 31), to tell us the limits of how closely we may place our actuators, it is better to look at these limits as something to shy away from.  We don't want our braille letters to be just noticably destinguishable, we want them to be easilly and obviously destinguishable.
  
  The sense of touch has a resolution of 1-45mm(page 30).  Normal braille cells have their dots separated by just 2.3-2.5 mm which really is just over the JND<www.brailleauthority.org/sizespacingofbraille/sizespacingofbraille.pdf>  Unfortunately, as we make our cell larger, it no longer fits on the tip of a finger.  On the finger's tip, the touch resolution is about 1mm, once we move out to the palm of the hand, this touch resolution balloons out to 11mm.  So indeed, by making our braille cell too large, we can end up with the unpleasant situation of actually having made things worse and not better.  It is my subjective fealing, that for an FCHAD, a cell of about 500mm in hight will be optimal, as it will cover the first two segments of the finger, which will be within range of high touch resolution, while not being so terribly small as normal braille.  When building my prototype, I did not have access to solenoids any variety of solenoids, so I could not choose the size I wanted.
  
  The successiveness limen(SL) is the minimum time required between two stimuli in order to perceive them as sepparate.  The FCHAD cell must be able to display 1 character per <100ms in order to compete with print braille. The absolute mechanoreceptor SL is 5ms, with a 20ms limen if we are to destinguish the ordering of the characters(which of course is vital to reading).(page 32)  Neither limen was approached during the course of this experiment.  The subjects did not learn to read so fast as to have problems with the temporal limen, and the solenoids were widely enough placed, that, even among the subjects whos hands were too small to cover the area with just their fingures, the placement was still wide enough to excede the palm resolution limen.  Furthermore, among the small handed subjects who never learned  to place their hands flatly on the cell at all, but continued to attempt to feal out each dot individually, these limens have no effect.

inferences about learning.pdf Liu, Yeou-Teh. Mayer-Kress, Gottfried. Newell, Karl M. Beyond Curve Fitting to Inferences About Learning

Advocates theory over data analysis in the study of learning curves.  Says that since learning itself is unobservable, then we should focus mainly on theory.  Talks about learning as a change in an unobservable dynamic system.  "theory is not just a goal but is also a useful guide as to what phenomena to look at and how to measure a construct."  "theory seems extracritical in the assessment of motor learning curves because, historically, the difference in persentage of variance accounted for in curve fitting different mathematical functions was often very small."  
 Measurement of Movement Time(MT) vs Absolute Error(AE)

R^2 and R_n analysis

Basically a rant against some guys named Heathcote and Brown.  Never knew science was so much about the drama.

learning curves 1917.pdf Swift, Edgar James. Studies in the Psychology and Physiology of Learning

Examines three types of learning:
 
 - "The acquisition of skill, or learning to do"

 - "The formation of associations, or the acquisition of information"

 - "the getting of control, or the formation of inihitions"

Three studies examine these types of learning:

 - "On tossing and Catching Balls"

 - "On learning Short-Hand"

 - "On the Acquisition and Control of the Reflex Wink"

On Tossing and Catching Balls
=======
Five subjects were to toss two similar balls into the air with one hand, such that only one ball would be thrown or recieved at any given time.  The subjects were to perform 10 sets a day for 30 day.  Each set involved throwing the balls untill the balls were dropped.  Like my study, this was a novel skill for the subjects.  However, many of them had seen balls before.  This study has a much larger time scale than mine.  The reasercher in this paper notes that the curves "are concave towards the the vertical axis, which means, of course, that the progress was first slow and then more rapid."  This shift in learing rate of change was over several days, and the beginning of curves are flattish.  Does that mean that my curves(over 45 minutes) will be flattish and that it would take several days to see that derivative start to change?  Or do we see a subcurve that is also concave in the FCAD data?  The question, is that when you look at the curve closely, does it look smooth, chaotic, or are there identifiable subpatterns near the start? 

This paper, despite it's age, is quite interesting to us, due to the classification of the types of learning.  In our study, all types of learning were present, but especially the first and the last.  At the begining of our study, the subjects were to read a completely novel text, and absorb the information about how the FCHAD works.  They were then to aquire a new skill, but also eliminate some old habbits.  One of the behaviors observed in Subjects 3 and 4, was that they repeatedly moved their hands too far to the left when returning to the start of a line.  These subjecs were used to reading on a peizoelectric braille display, which is considerably longer than the row of sensors used in the study.  They had to unlearn their old habbit while learning a new one.

This study is also interesting, in that it shows clearly layed out objective data, without any extraneous curve fitting or other BS like the overuse of logarithmic scales which might make things look prettier.  The only beatification of the data is one shared by my own plotting method.  That is the connecting of the individual points along the curve with a strait line.  The reasercher also writes about each subject, and the external factors that affected them.  While this makes the study look less proffi, it is actually far more scientific than the modern studies where, in the clownish name of objectivism, these "personal" details are ommited. However, this study does have it's faults.  When examining the "conditions that Influence the Learning Process" our author has made the mistake of attributing as well as observing.  He writes, for example, "D lost sleep so often after the first four or five days, on account of sickenss in his family, that his curve came to represent the effect of physical condition on the progress rather than the learning process.:  When exhausted from loss of sleep he lost the skill that he had gained before." This may be true, that the reason for his unexpected curve was loss of sleep, however we cannot be sure!  The author should have postulated more tenatively!

One of the interesting things was the inclusion of how the subjects "felt".  This is often discouraged, indeed, we were discouraged from using such information when I took Psych101.  The historic practice is actualy a very scientific one.  The idea that reducing the amount of information one records increases the objectiveness of that information is totally wrongheaded.  The more information recorded, the more scientific the study, period.

Another point of discussion is the intrest in the results of the study and the desire to perform well on the side of the subjects.  In my own subjects, this may have had an effect.  Subject 4, declared that the invention was interesting, and that he could definitely see a use for it in the developing world.  He also outperformed subjects 5 and 6 significantly(there are other factors too, he is a college student while the other two were still at the gymnasium). Subject 5 however expressed no interest whatsoever, when she was asked if she had any comments on the device, she said she had none and left the testing area imeadiately after finishing the trail.  Subject 6 did coment on the device, but said he thought it was compilcated.  While we could assume that his negative assesment was due to his poor performance I must note that he does not a braille display now, prefering speach.  If we were to go out on a limb, we could say that he probably was less interested in the task because he does not like computer braille in general.  It is clear, that in our tiny sample size of 3, interest strongly correlates to performance.
  The reasearcher also suggests that loss of intrest can also manifest in the form of boredome.  Despite my own sesssions lasting 45 minutes, I did not have the fealing that my subjects were bored.  Fatigued, perhaps, but they were not bored.  The task remained a challange to both subjects 5 and 6 throughout, and subject 4 improved at such a rate as to prevent him from becoming bored with it.  The reasercher also examines the effect of goal setting and competition on the throwers ability.  When the throwers were nearing a goal, they would perform better, and this was seen in the data.  While my subjects were informed of their progress, or atleast of their erroneous and or correct reading, they did not have any firm set goals.  This may have hampered their progress, but surely reduced confounding factors.  We could see, the aproach of the end of the line as being an unstated goal for the subjects.  I don't know, it was never said outloud.  Sometimes, the subjects would think that the end of the line had been reached one character before the end.  I think this was due to confusion rather than anticipation however.  The sensors were close enough together that two or three would be touched at any one time.  I think that the subjects felt that the sensor directly bellow their finger was the one being pressed, when indeed, the computer interprets the touched sensor as the one which is touched which is farthest to the left.  
Another note of the researcher is the way to which his subjects reacted to errors.  This is a place where the FCHAD study differes significantly from the ball tossing study.  While the ball tossing study focusses entirely on error free throwing, errors in the FCHAD study took a seccond place to speed.  The way in which my subjects adapted to their errors was a crutial factor in the speed of their reading.  All of the subjects made the error of ignoring the seccond row of pins, and reading only from the first row, and all of my subjects made the error of failing to realise that pin 3 was raised, because they had not felt that far down on the display.  All of the subjects, in responce to failing to read a pin would then procede to "check" that pin, while reading the letters that followed.  This of course slowed them down.  However, subject 4 realized that checking pin 3 would slow his reading down, so he transitioned from this manual error prevention method, to a more natural flattening of his hand, so that he wouldn't make the error in the first place. Subjects 5 and 6 did not make this adaptation well.  Near the end of subject 5's trial, I asked her to try placing her hand flat on the display.  the results were TODO TODO TODO
