Learing curves of the FCHAD braille display
===============================

The interesting aspect of this study is the novelty of the task being learned.  The task of using an FCHAD display is both complex and novel.  While the participants of the study all had experience with classical braille text and peizoelectric braille displays none of them had ever heard of, not to mention used, an FCHAD device.  This fact was ensured, by the fact that at the time of the study, only one FCHAD device existed in the entire world and it's invention has remained unknown.
