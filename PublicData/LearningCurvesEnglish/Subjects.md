I am Subject 0

Subject 1
===========
The first exploratory session was cut short by technical failiure of the device.  No significant data was gathered.


Subject 2
=========
The second exploratory session.

Subject 2 is apx 50 years old and teaches the german language at the university level.  She has used braille for 35 years and uses a peizoelectric braille display at home.  She has a university level education.  She is blind.  I visited her during her office hours and spent approximately one hour with her.  She seemed well rested and never showed any sign of frustration during the course of the session.

The session began with me setting up the display and asking some initial questions.  I did not tell her any details about the device, except that it is a prototype and that it did not currently have a battery.  Indeed, the start of the session was delayed as we had to aquire an extension cable.

  The subject did not manipulate with the device while I was setting it up. 

Subject 3
========
The third exploratory session.
Subject 3 is a college student around 25 years of age.  His current highest attained level of education is a hich school diploma.  He is completely blind and has a mild hearing impairment corrected with electronic hearing aids.
We peformed the session during a break between two classes in a large but empty lecture hall.  The session was mared by a great deal of technical failiures on the part of my device.  The firmware froze up a number of times and this lead to the first half hour of the study having very hard to interpret results.
  Furthermore, during the print reading section of the study our subject did not read the sample text outloud.  I stopped him when he began to turn the page.  This means that we have to calculate his benchmark print braille reading speed differently, using only the part after the page turn, rather than the whole text.
  Despite these technical failiures our subject was able to learn to use the device to some degree of proficiency during our session.  He understood the device almost imediately without any of the repeated cues that were given to Subject 2.  Both subjects use a braille display at home.  Both subjects are completely blind.  Subject 3 is younger than subject 2.  Another factor, is that I chose to guide his hands much less during the begining of the study, instead asking him to explore the device himself.

I would devide our session into two halves.  The first half was mared by device failiures.  The resistive touch inteface requires a good contact with the skin of two electrodes, the positive electrode and the sensor(selector) electrode.  Due to the fact that subject 3 has more hair on his arm(where the positive electrode was atached) a good contact was not made with the skin.  This lead to many touch signals getting sent to the device, as the electrode came in and out of contact with the skin.  Within the first secconds of attempting to use the device, subject 3 placed his right hand(correctly) on the first metal sensor electrode.  He then began to feal with two fingers of his left hand the dots of the braille cell.  Once he had determined the character correctly(he was verbally prompted with confirmations, or denials of his guesses) he(again correctly) proceded to the next sensor electrode.  Here, we see that the single paragraph of text instructing him on the use of the device and some pedagogic guidance sufficed for him to understand the gist of the devices usage.  The pedagogic guidance was as follows:
 - I asked him to find the row of sensor electrodes and begin with the first letter.  He seemed to not understand or not react to this command.  
 - I placed his right hand on the braille cell, and his right hand on the row of sensor electrodes.  I then dragged his fingers lightly across the electrodes and told him that those were the sensors he was to use to select the character.
 - I then asked him again to begin reading.

After that short guidance he did begin to read as I metioned before, and continued to read the full line of text without guidance except for verbal confirmation/denial cues as to whether he had guessed the correct letter.
  As with subject 2 he made several mistakes in identifying the letters.
The most common mistake was to disregard dots 5 or 6 of the braille cell(in the case that dot 4 was raised), thus reading y` as p(for example).
 The seccond common mistake he made was to recognize dot 2 as dot 1 thus thinking i was c.  This is a mistake that I myself made often when I was first learning to use the device.

  If I had some electrolite gell with me at the time, I could have solved this problem, however I had to make due with what I had.  I asked Subject 3 to hold the positive electrode in his hand so that it could have better contact with his skin.  He did this and afterwards he was able to use the device without any more failiures.  At this time, he was able to read relatively well, but not fluently.

Post pre study sessions notes
============
After the exploratory pre study sessions several things are clear:
 - The crashes in the firmware must be located and removed so as to prevent interuptions during the normal study.
 - The layout of the sensor electrodes must be improved so that they are more regularly placed.
 - I need to choose some concrete phenomenon to study so that data gathering can be complete.
 - I need to better define my interaction with the subjects so that my interaction will not be an overwelming factor in the results.
