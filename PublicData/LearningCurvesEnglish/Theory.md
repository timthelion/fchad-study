Implicit vs Explicit learning

implicit learning seperated from explicit learning
125 students from University of Virginia are asked to fill a SRT task.
Task, match one of 4 keystrokes to a coresponding dot on the screen.

Explicit instructions:
Learn the 12 element sequence.  (Explicit aid in learling the task.)

Implicit: respond as quickly as possible.  Sequence is still there, not explicitly pointed out.
The subjects given the explicit sequence learning task at first performed much more slowly than the subjects performing the implicit task, however, their responce times decreased as the study continued and the resulting responce times were similar to those subjects given the implicit task.  It seems to me, that in the first hour of using the novel Braille display all learning is implicit.  The subjects of my study are given an explicit verbal explanation of the devices function, and explicit verbal instructions as to what to do during the study.

In the University of Virginia study, subjects are given a task which is simple enough, that they may begin implicit training almost right away.  However, the novel braille display is significantly more complex and explicit learning MUST come first.  Furthermore, since my subjects are blind, implicit learning involving "watch and copy" learning models is impossible.  All initial learning is either unguided exploration and discovery or explicit verbal command.

While blind individuals cannot engage in "watch and copy" learning they can experience a movement without peforming that movement actively.  That is, we can place their hands where their hands can go on the device.
