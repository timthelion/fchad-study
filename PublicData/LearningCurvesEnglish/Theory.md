Implicit vs Explicit learning

Functional imaging

implicit learning seperated from explicit learning

125 students from University of Virginia are asked to fill a SRT task.

Task, match one of 4 keystrokes to a coresponding dot on the screen.

Explicit instructions:

Learn the 12 element sequence.  (Explicit aid in learling the task.)

Implicit: respond as quickly as possible.  Sequence is still there, not explicitly pointed out.

The subjects given the explicit sequence learning task at first performed much more slowly than the subjects performing the implicit task, however, their responce times decreased as the study continued and the resulting responce times were similar to those subjects given the implicit task.  It seems to me, that in the first hour of using the novel Braille display all learning is implicit.  The subjects of my study are given an explicit verbal explanation of the devices function, and explicit verbal instructions as to what to do during the study.

In the University of Virginia study, subjects are given a task which is simple enough, that they may begin implicit training almost right away.  However, the novel braille display is significantly more complex and explicit learning MUST come first.  Furthermore, since my subjects are blind, implicit learning involving "watch and copy" learning models is impossible.  All initial learning is either unguided exploration and discovery or explicit verbal command.

While blind individuals cannot engage in "watch and copy" learning they can experience a movement without peforming that movement actively.  That is, we can place their hands where their hands can go on the device.  

Optocon modes:

"A second conclusion is that the performance for very brief, static patterns could be improved considerably by increasing the amplitude of vibration generation the pattern. It is conceivable that if the amplitude of the Optacon display could be increased to even greater levels, the percentage correct for letters presented for 4 msec would be as great as that for letters presented for 200msec." <- Is this meaningfull?  I think not, because back masking will probably still have more affect on a 4ms impulse than a 200ms stimulation  Page 10.

4msec is not a vibration but a single impulse.

It would be good to look into adding a backward mask dellay pg 12. in the future.

Page 15, no reason to exceed 50msec for static paterns.
