An examination of first impressions, adaptation and learning over a short period with novel material.
 In this study, I have examined how subjects react to, and learn to use, an FCHAD braille display.  The pedagogic atmosphere of this study is strict and drill based.  Particular focus is placed on how students adapt during the course of a drill.  The study was performed similarly to many learning curve studies, yet differs in that a teaching element was explicitly included rather than explicitly excluded.
